        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> because in my old life I was a accounting clerk...yes long story). It's funny because I know code because the accounting field, I was to do SQL to build some financial report in my last job. After that , I was work in a accounting firm and I decided to swith in information technology. So here I am! I learn to code because I like to create something I just feel at my rigth place and alive. When I am not code I love to drawing, mixig , do yoga and kung fu.</p>
